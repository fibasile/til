I'm [Fiore Basile](./about), expert in [web technologies](https://github.com/fibasile), [digital fabrication](https://fabctory.com) and [distributed education](http://academany.org).

You can [hire me](mailto:fiore.basile at gmail.com) for consulting in hw-sw projects, interactive installations, for speaking at events, running workshops or building from the grounds up your new Fab Lab.

I'm currently based in Pisa, Italy but I'm always available to travel worldwide for an interesting project.
